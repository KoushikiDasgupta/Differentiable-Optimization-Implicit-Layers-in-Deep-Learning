# Differentiable-Optimization-Implicit-Layers-in-Deep-Learning
Implementation of differentiable convex optimisation implicit layers using Cvxpy package in Python
Studied differentiable convex optimisation implicit layers and implemented them using Cvxpy package in Python on a toy denoising problem.
Investigated the utility of differentiable layers in neural networks for learning consistent PDE differential operators by embedding hard moment constraints in the implicit layers.
